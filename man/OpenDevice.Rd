\title{Open a graphics device.}
\usage{
OpenDevice(device = "quartz", path, file.name, type = "pdf", height = 6,
  width = 8, save.plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{device}{Character string specifying the plotting device; defaults to
"quartz" which is suitable for macOS systems. Currently, no other devices
are implemented.}

\item{path}{The path to the directory in which to save the plot (for
\code{save.plot = TRUE}). If the specified directory does not exist, a
warning is issed but nevertheless the function attempts to create the
directory.}

\item{file.name}{The name of the file under which to save the plot.}

\item{type}{The type of output to use. Defaults to \code{pdf}.}

\item{height}{The height of the graphics device; defaults to 6 inches.}

\item{width}{The width of the graphics device; defaults to 8 inches.}

\item{save.plot}{if \code{TRUE} a file stream is opened according to
\code{file.path} to save the plot as a pdf file. Defaults to \code{FALSE}
which simply opens a device window. Setting \code{save.plot} to \code{TRUE}
without specying a \code{file.path} results in an error.}
}
\description{
