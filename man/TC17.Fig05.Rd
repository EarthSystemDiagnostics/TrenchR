\title{Produce TC17 Figure 05.}
\usage{
TC17.Fig05(dat = NULL, path = file.path(getwd(), "plots"),
  file.name = "tc17_fig_05", device = "quartz", save.plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data resulting from a call of \code{\link{LoopParamSpace}}; if
\code{NULL} (the default), the original data presented in Muench et
al. (2017) is used for plotting which is supplied with this package under
\code{\link{ParamSpace}}.}

\item{path}{The path to the directory in which to save the plot (for
\code{save.plot = TRUE}). Defaults to the folder \code{plots} in the current
working directory. If this folder does not exist, it is attempted to create
with a warning (see also \code{\link{OpenDevice}}).}

\item{file.name}{The name of the file (excluding extension) to save the
plot in.}

\item{save.plot}{if \code{TRUE}, the plot is saved as a png file in the
folder specified by \code{path}. Defaults to \code{FALSE} which results in
on-screen display of the plot.}

\item{dev.size}{The graphics device to be used to display and save the
plot. Defaults to the \code{quartz} device which is the only currently
implemented device option.}
