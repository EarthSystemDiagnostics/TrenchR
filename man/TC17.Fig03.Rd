\usage{
TC17.Fig03(TR, path = file.path(getwd(), "plots"),
  file.name = "tc17_fig_03", device = "quartz", save.plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{TR}{The results from a call to \code{\link{prepareTrenchData(na.treat
= TRUE)}}.}

\item{path}{The path to the directory in which to save the plot (for
\code{save.plot = TRUE}). Defaults to the folder \code{plots} in the current
working directory. If this folder does not exist, it is attempted to create
