#' Correlation between profiles depending on distance
#'
#' Estimate the pairwise correlation between trench profiles as a function of
#' the distance between the profiles.
#'
#' For a given distance, the function searches the trench data set for all pairs
#' which are separated horizontally by this distance, allowing for a given
#' tolerance in separation distance. It is ensured that profile pairs are
#' counted only once. For every found pair, the correlation between the two
#' profiles is calculated using pairwise complete observations, and the
#' correlations are averaged across all pairs. Uncertainty of the mean
#' correlation is given by the standard deviation across the correlations from
#' all pairs, and by the standard error. The latter is obtained from dividing
#' the standard deviation by the square root of an effective number of
#' observations, which is calculated from the number of found pairs and the
#' average horizontal distance between the trench profiles for the given
#' horizontal autocorrelation (see \code{\link{getEffectiveTrenchDOF}}). This is
#' still an optimistic error estimate, since e.g. the correlation values from
#' two profile pairs located at positions [1, 2] and [2, 3] are certainly not
#' independent, even when accounting for autocorrelation.
#'
#' @param trench a trench data set in form of a matrix or a data frame, where
#'   columns represent the horizontal trench profile positions and rows
#'   represent the vertical scale of the data; see also \code{\link{make2D}}.
#' @param profilePosition vector of the horizontal trench profile positions; see
#'   also \code{\link{getSurfaceProfile}}.
#' @param distances vector of profile spacings for which profile pairs shall be
#'   seeked and analysed for their correlation; must have the same units as
#'   \code{profilePosition}.
#' @param rangeTol relative tolerance allowed for profile spacings; i.e. for a
#'   given spacing d, all profile pairs separated by d * (1 +/- rangeTol) are
#'   analysed.
#' @param a1 horizontal autocorrelation of the trench data at lag 1 to obtain an
#'   effective number of profiles used for the error estimates (see details).
#' @return a tibble of five variables: the analysed profile spacings, the found
#'   number of pairs, the mean correlation between the pairs, and the standard
#'   deviation and standard error of the mean correlation (see details).
