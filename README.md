# Sedproxy: Simulation of Sediment Archived Climate Proxy Records.

------------------------------

## Introduction

**TrenchR** provides a forward model for sediment archived climate proxies. It is based on work described in Laepple and Huybers (2013). A manuscript is in preparation, Dolman and Laepple (in prep.), which will more fully describe the forward model and its applications. Please contact Dr Andrew Dolman <<andrew.dolman@awi.de>>, or Dr Thomas Laepple <<tlaepple@awi.de>>, at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Germany, for more information.

 
## Installation

**TrenchR** can be installed directly from bitbucket


```r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_bitbucket("ecus/trenchr")
```

## Dependencies

The following packages are needed for **TrenchR** to function properly:
* geosphere
* GISTools
* Hmisc
* RColorBrewer

These packages are available on CRAN and are automatically installed on your system, if not yet present, when installing **TrenchR**.
